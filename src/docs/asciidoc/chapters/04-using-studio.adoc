=== Pros of using the full platform

[%step]
* Low code development
* Visual representation of the process
* Business data editor
* WYSIWYG editor to create pages and forms
* Platform to administrate processes / users
* Out of the box user case list

=== As a developer...

I want everything as code in one place

=== Another approach

A *DSL* to code processes and execute them using an *Embedded engine*
