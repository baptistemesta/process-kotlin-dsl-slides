=== Studio to design processes

=== Demo

import application in studio + start


=== Pros of using the full platform

[%step]
* Visual representation of the process
* Business data editor
* WYSIWYG editor to create pages and forms
* Low code development
* Platform to administrate processes / users
* Out of the box user case list

=== As a developer...

[%step]
* I want no setup of a platform
* I want everything as code (no clicking)
* I prefere code than diagrams
* I want my business logic in one place

=== An other approach

Embbed processes and Execution engine in our application
