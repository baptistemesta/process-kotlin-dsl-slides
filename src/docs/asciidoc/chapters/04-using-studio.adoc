=== Demo

import application in studio + start


=== Pros of using the full platform

[%step]
* Visual representation of the process
* Low code development
* The platform handle the full application
** User interfaces
** Business data in a separated database
** Adminitration interface of the processes / users
* Platform cluster for HA

=== As a developer I want all as code and all in the same place

[%step]
* I want no setup of a platform
* I want everything as code (no clicking)
* I prefere code than diagrams
* I want my business logic in one place

=== An other approach

Embed processes and Execution engine in our application
