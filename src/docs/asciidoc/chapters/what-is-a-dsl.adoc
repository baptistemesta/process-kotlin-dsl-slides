== What is a DSL?


=== Domain specific language

[quote, Martin Fowler]
The basic idea of a domain specific language (DSL) is a computer language that's targeted to a particular kind of problem, rather than a general purpose language that's aimed at any kind of software problem.


=== External DSLs

[%step]
* Not backed by a language
* Define your grammar
* Create your tools to validate
* "Compile" for your target domain


=== Internal DSLs

[%step]
* Backed by a language
* Limited to the features of the language
* Re-use tooling of the language


=== We already uses DSLs

Spock framework
[source,groovy]
----
def "should return user given its id and tenant id"() {
    given:
    def expectedUser = aUser(new User(id: 1))
    when:
    def user = repository.findById(1).get()
    then:
    user == expectedUser
}

=== We already uses DSLs

Gradle DSL
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    `kotlin-dsl`
}
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile("commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient:3.1")
}
